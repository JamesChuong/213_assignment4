Assignment 4 for CMPT 213
In this part of the assignment you will be creating a Spring Boot REST API for your assignment 3!
The course website provides a fully implemented web client front end that you can add to your project.
Create a new Spring Boot project and extract the provided web client files into a /public folder in the
root of your project.
When you run your project, Spring Boot will automatically serve up files in the /public folder to the
web browser. So you should be able to browse to it at http://localhost:8080
